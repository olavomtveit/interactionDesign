Lesson Assignment 1.1

User's goals: 
Be able to easily turn on and off the power cord with my feet so it can be "hidden" under my desktop. 
It will make it less costly and safer if it can easily be turned off. 

Constraints: 
It has a short power cord, and could use 1-2 more sockets. When used for a dekstop setup, 4 sockets will quickly be filled.

Design limitations: 
There's no indication that shows the user if the power is on or off. 

How to improve design: 
I have two ways to improve the design.
1. When you press the button and turn it on it should give a blue light to indicate that it is on.
2. When you press the button and turn it on the button should "stay down" a bit so it indicates it is turned on. 

Note: The on/off button is colored blue so it tricks the user into thinking it will light up when turned on.
Which is why I bought it in the first place. #falseadvertising
